As an unauthenticated user, I will see a screen populated with random GIF’s based on words like “hello,” “welcome,” or “hi,” and a big log in with Twitter button. If I click on the login button, I will see a popup with the Twitter authentication system.  If I do not have a Twitter, I can click on the “Don’t have a Twitter?” link and it will redirect me to the create account page on Twitter. If I click on a GIF, it will pop up and tell me to log in. 

If the login is successful I will be redirected to the home screen of the application which will show a bunch of GIFs. If the login is unsuccessful I will be directed to an error page which will show me a funny GIF and ask me to try to login again.
