As an unauthenticated user, I will see a screen populated with random GIFs based on words like "hello," "welcome," or "hi," and a big "login with Twitter" button. If I click on the login button, I will see a pop-up with the Twitter authentication system. If I do not have a Twitter, I can click on the "Don’t have a Twitter?" link and it will redirect me to the "create account" page on Twitter. If I click on a GIF, it will prompt a pop-up that tells me to log in.

If the login is successful, I will be redirected to the application’s home screen which will show a bunch of GIFs/images. If the login is unsuccessful, I will be directed to an error page which will show me a funny GIF and ask me to try logging in again.
