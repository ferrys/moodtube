As an authenticated user I will see a home screen with an “Analyze My Mood” button. If I click on this button, I will be given two buttons: either “Pick a Mood” or “Analyze My Tweets.”
	
If I click “Pick a Mood,” I will be given a list of options including common moods with keywords such as “sad,” “angry,” or “happy.” If I click on one option, the home page will be updated to show GIFs/images that reflect my choice. If I click on another option, the GIFs/images will be updated to reflect the refined search.

If I click “Analyze My Tweets,” I will see a loading screen with a GIF and then the homepage will update to reflect my mood based on Twitter sentiment analysis.
